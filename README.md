What's that?
-------

Some useful stuff forked from dtonhofer/smart_diskinfo. I added some modifications to suit my needs.

Also added check_mk local script that pulls vital SMART parameters and flags up when things go pear shaped. 
This is Check_mk local check script for FreeBSD based NAS like NAS4FREE, but can be easly adapted for any *nix using smartmontoolsI suppose. Drop a copy to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/
